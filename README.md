# Ballad Salad - https://balladsalad.com

Ballad Salad is a web-application that allows users to create text posts (similar to websites such as Twitter). However, instead of forcing a character or word limit, Ballad Salad has unique post requirements. All posts must fit into a selected Rhyme Scheme and Meter.

### Currently Available Meters
- Petrarchan Sonnets
- Shakesperean Sonnets
- Spenserean Sonnets
- Tetrameter Ballads
- Heroic Couplets
- Haiku
- Limericks (Under Construction)

### App Specifications
The app is built using Node.js and MongoDB on a Debian server.

Rhymes are reviewed using the Datamuse API (https://www.datamuse.com/api/) 



### TODO
 - add more meters
 - add meter descriptions
 - add meter variations for specific poem types (e.g. Limericks)
